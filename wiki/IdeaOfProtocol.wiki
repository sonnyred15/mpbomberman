#short description of protocol

= Protocol =

Currently only tcp\ip asynchronous connection is supported. Asynchronous means that server can send some messages to client without requests from client side(like, for example, in http).

Protocol message consists of:
    * signed 32 bit integer - *_Identificator of message_*
    * another one signed 32 bit integer - *_Number of elements in data_*
    * elements of data, currently UTF String - *_data of message_*

So, in java it looks like this:
{{{
List<String> data = message.getData();
int size = data.size();

out.writeInt(message.getMessageId());
out.writeInt(size);
for (String string : data) {
    out.writeUTF(string);
}
}}}
