==Technical information==
All that follow below is taken from java.io.DataInputStream and java,io.DataOutputStream.
===How works writeInt===
Writes an int value, which is comprised of four bytes, to the output stream. The byte values to be written, in the order shown, are: 
    *`(byte)(0xff & (v >> 24))
    *`(byte)(0xff & (v >> 16))
    *`(byte)(0xff & (v >> 8))
    *`(byte)(0xff & v)
===How works writeUTF===
Each character in the string s is converted to a group of one, two, or three bytes, depending on the value of the character.

If a character c is in the range \u0001 through \u007f, it is represented by one byte:
   *`(byte)c 
If a character c is \u0000 or is in the range \u0080 through \u07ff, then it is represented by two bytes, to be written in the order shown:
    *`(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
    *`(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
  
If a character c is in the range \u0800 through uffff, then it is represented by three bytes, to be written in the order shown:

    *`(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
    *`(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >>  6)))
    *`(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))

*First, the total number of bytes needed to represent all the characters of s is calculated.* Note that it can`t be more than 65535. This length is written to the output stream as:
    *`(byte)(0xff & (v >> 8))
    *`(byte)(0xff & v)
And after this the string is writed as described above...
